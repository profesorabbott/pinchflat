## What it does

Pinchflat is a self-hosted app for downloading YouTube content built using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). It's designed to be lightweight, self-contained, and easy to use. You set up rules for how to download content from YouTube channels or playlists, and it'll do the rest, periodically checking for new content. It's perfect for people who want to download content for use with a media center app (Plex, Jellyfin, Kodi) or for those who want to archive media!

While you can [download individual videos](https://github.com/CommunityMaintained/pinchflat/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-download-one-off-videos), Pinchflat is best suited for downloading content from channels or playlists. It's also not meant for consuming content in-app - Pinchflat downloads content to disk, where you can then watch it with a media center app or VLC.

If it doesn't work for your use case, please make a feature request! You can also check out these great alternatives: [Tube Archivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist), [ytdl-sub](https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub), and [TubeSync](https://github.com/meeb/tubesync)

## Installation

### Unraid

~~Simply search for Pinchflat in the Community Apps store!~~

- Currently unavailable.

### Portainer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See the note below about storing config on a network file share. It's preferred to store the config on a local disk if at all possible.

Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  pinchflat:
    image: ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest
    environment:
      # Set the timezone to your local timezone
      - TZ=America/New_York
    ports:
      - '8945:8945'
    volumes:
      - /host/path/to/config:/config
      - /host/path/to/downloads:/downloads
```

### Docker

1. Create two directories on your host machine: one for storing config and one for storing downloaded media. Make sure they're both writable by the user running the Docker container.
2. Prepare the Docker image in one of the two ways below:
   - **From GHCR:** `docker pull ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest`
     - NOTE: also available on Docker Hub at `communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest`
   - **Building locally:** `docker build . --file docker/selfhosted.Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest`
3. Run the container:

```bash
# Be sure to replace /host/path/to/config and /host/path/to/downloads below with
# the paths to the directories you created in step 1
# Be sure to replace America/New_York with your local timezone
docker run \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -p 8945:8945 \
  -v /host/path/to/config:/config \
  -v /host/path/to/downloads:/downloads \
  ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest
```

### Podman

The Podman setup is similar to Docker, but changes a few flags to run under a User Namespace instead of root. To run Pinchflat under Podman and use the current user's UID/GID for file access, run this:

```
podman run \
  --security-opt label=disable \
  --userns=keep-id --user=$UID \
  -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
  -p 8945:8945 \
  -v /host/path/to/config:/config:rw \
  -v /host/path/to/downloads/:/downloads:rw \
  ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest
```

Using this setup, consider creating a new `pinchflat` user and giving that user ownership of the config and download directory. See [Podman --userns](https://docs.podman.io/en/v4.6.1/markdown/options/userns.container.html) docs.

### IMPORTANT: File permissions

You _must_ ensure the host directories you've mounted are writable by the user running the Docker container. If you get a permission error, follow the steps it suggests. See [upstream #106](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat/issues/106) for more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not recommended to run the container as root. Doing so can create permission issues if other apps need to work with the downloaded media.

### ADVANCED: Storing Pinchflat config directory on a network share

As pointed out in [upstream #137](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat/issues/137), SQLite doesn't like being run in WAL mode on network shares. If you're running Pinchflat on a network share, you can disable WAL mode by setting the `JOURNAL_MODE` environment variable to `delete`. This will make Pinchflat run in rollback journal mode, which is less performant but should work on network shares.

> [!CAUTION]
> Changing this setting from WAL to `delete` on an existing Pinchflat instance could, conceivably, result in data loss. Only change this setting if you know what you're doing, why this is important, and are okay with possible data loss or DB corruption. Backup your database first!

If you change this setting and it works well for you, please open an issue or leave a comment on [upstream #137](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat/issues/137)! Doubly so if it does _not_ work well.

### Reverse Proxies

Pinchflat makes heavy use of websockets for real-time updates. If you're running Pinchflat behind a reverse proxy, then you'll need to make sure it's configured to support websockets.

#### Caddy Proxy Example

To configure Pinchflat behind Caddy, set the `BASE_ROUTE_PATH` environment variable to `/pinchflat/` then add a stanza like this to the `Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
home.example.com:443 {
  redir /pinchflat /pinchflat/

  handle_path /pinchflat/* {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8945
  }
}
```

## Migrating from kieraneglin/pinchflat

The data format is identical — no database changes are needed. Just update the image reference in your Docker run command or compose file:

```text
ghcr.io/kieraneglin/pinchflat:latest  →  ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest
```

Also available on Docker Hub as `communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest`.

Stop the old container, update the image reference, and start it again. Your `/config` and `/downloads` volumes carry over unchanged.

### Returning to kieraneglin/pinchflat

You can switch back to upstream (Kieran's image) at any time by simply pointing the image to `ghcr.io/kieraneglin/pinchflat:latest`. If you wish to make a 100% clean return, run the one-off command below **first**. It removes all traces of this from the Pinchflat's database.

```bash
docker compose run --rm pinchflat bin/pinchflat eval "Pinchflat.Release.prep_for_upstream()"
```

The command drops the fork-only DB columns, removes their migration records so the ledger matches upstream too, and exits. Next, just switch the image reference to upstream next and start the container. If you start this fork again instead, it re-adds its columns automatically and keeps working (it self-heals rather than breaking).

> This step is **optional** — return works without it. It exists only for users who want an identical schema. The dropped columns (e.g. the yt-dlp update policy and unavailable-media status) are removed along with their data.
